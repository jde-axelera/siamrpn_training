## 1. Background: From Detection to Tracking

If you are familiar with YOLO-style detection, the key mental shift is this:

> **Detection** asks *"what objects are in this image?"*
> **Tracking** asks *"where did this specific object go in the next frame?"*

A YOLO model is trained to recognise categories (car, person, drone). At inference it scans a single image and outputs all bounding boxes by class. It has no memory — each frame is processed in isolation.

A **visual tracker** does something fundamentally different. You give it one reference image of a target — called the **template** — and it continuously localises that same instance across subsequent video frames, regardless of what category it belongs to. It never needs to know if the target is a drone, a bird, or a boat. It just asks: *"does this patch of pixels look like my template?"*

This distinction matters for IR/thermal deployment:
- IR imagery lacks the colour and texture cues that category-based detectors rely on.
- You often want to track a specific intruder drone, not detect all drones in the scene.
- Trackers are more robust to domain shift because they match appearance, not a learned class prototype.

## 2. Architecture: How SiamRPN++ Works

SiamRPN++ is a **Siamese network** — two branches sharing the same backbone weights that process two inputs simultaneously.

```
Template (127×127 px)          Search Region (255×255 px)
        │                                │
   ┌────▼────┐                      ┌────▼────┐
   │Backbone │  ResNet-50 + FPN     │Backbone │  (shared weights)
   └────┬────┘                      └────┬────┘

        └──────────┬─────────────────────┘

        ┌──────────▼──────────┐
        │     RPN Head        │  cls + loc branches
        └──────────┬──────────┘
                   │
        ┌──────────┴──────────┐
        │  cls (1,10,25,25)   │  ← 5 anchors × 2 (fg/bg) × 25×25 grid
        │  loc (1,20,25,25)   │  ← 5 anchors × 4 (dx,dy,dw,dh) × 25×25 grid
        └─────────────────────┘
```

### Key components

**Siamese backbone (shared weights)**
Both the template and search crops pass through the same ResNet-50. Because the weights are shared, both branches learn the same feature representation — similarity in feature space corresponds to visual similarity in image space.

**FPN neck (multi-scale)**
A Feature Pyramid Network aggregates features from layers 2, 3, and 4 of ResNet-50, giving three feature scales `zf_0 / zf_1 / zf_2`. This helps handle targets at different scales.

**Depth-wise cross-correlation (DW-XCorr)**
This is the core of the Siamese approach. The template features `zf` act as a *learned sliding filter* that is convolved over the search features `xf`. Positions in the resulting response map with high activation indicate where the search region looks most similar to the template.

In YOLO terms: instead of a fixed classifier head reading from backbone features, SiamRPN++ uses the *template itself* as a dynamic query kernel. The backbone learns to produce feature maps where cross-correlation naturally peaks at the target location.

**RPN head (same concept as YOLO)**
A region proposal network identical in spirit to what Faster-RCNN and YOLOv2+ use — a 25×25 spatial grid, 5 anchor aspect ratios per location (0.33, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0), each predicting:
- `cls`: is this anchor on the target (fg) or background (bg)?
- `loc`: dx, dy, dw, dh offsets to refine the anchor to the exact box.

Total anchors per frame: 25 × 25 × 5 = **3,125** — all evaluated in a single forward pass.

### At inference

1. **Initialisation (once per target):** Crop the target from the first frame → run through the template encoder → cache `zf_0 / zf_1 / zf_2`.
2. **Every frame:** Crop a 255×255 search region centred on the last known position → run through the tracker model with the cached `zf` → decode the highest-scoring anchor → update position.

This is why export produces **two separate ONNX models** — the template encoder runs once, the tracker runs every frame.

## 3. Training: How It Differs from YOLO

| Aspect | YOLO training | SiamRPN++ training |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Input | Single image per sample | (template crop, search crop) pair from the same video |
| Label | Class ID + bbox per object | Binary fg/bg + bbox for the *one* tracked object |
| Loss | Multi-class CE + box regression | Binary CE (focal) + smooth-L1 (same as RPN) |
| Dataset | Images with annotations | Video sequences with per-frame bbox tracks |
| Category awareness | Yes — 80 COCO classes | None — similarity-based, category-agnostic |
| Epoch structure | One pass through the dataset | Fixed budget of N random (template, search) pairs |
| Batch item | One image | One (z, x) pair sampled from a random sequence |

### Why pairs, not full frames?

The Siamese network must learn what *similarity* looks like, not what categories look like. To create a training signal, you need two crops of the same object:
- **Template** `z`: a 127×127 crop centred on the target with 0.5× context padding at frame `t`.
- **Search region** `x`: a 255×255 crop centred near the same target at frame `t + δ` (δ = 1–100 frames), with the target potentially shifted, scaled, or partially occluded.

The model must output high classification scores and accurate offsets at the anchor overlapping the target in `x`, and low scores everywhere else. All other anchors are background.

### Loss

```
L_total = L_cls + λ · L_loc

L_cls = Binary cross-entropy (weighted: ignore anchors with IoU 0.3–0.6, 
                                         positive: IoU > 0.6, 
                                         negative: IoU < 0.3)
L_loc = Smooth-L1 on (dx, dy, dw, dh) for positive anchors only
λ     = 1.2   (balances classification vs. localisation)
```

## 5. Datasets

Nine IR/thermal datasets are used. All annotations are automatically converted to a unified PySOT JSON format during the pipeline setup step.

### Dataset inventory

| # | Dataset | Size | Domain | Source |
|---|---------|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | **Anti-UAV410** | 410 seqs, 9.4 GB | IR UAV tracking | Google Drive (`gdown`) |
| 2 | **Anti-UAV300** | IR video sequences | IR UAV tracking | Google Drive (`gdown`) |
| 3 | **MSRS** | 1,444 image pairs | Paired IR/visible road | GitHub (`git clone` + LFS) |
| 4 | **VT-MOT / PFTrack** | 582 seqs, 401K frames | RGB+IR multi-object | Baidu Cloud (code: `chcw`) |
| 5 | **MassMIND** | 2,916 LWIR images | Maritime LWIR | Google Drive (`gdown`) |
| 6 | **MVSS-Baseline** | Video sequences | RGB-thermal video seg | Google Drive (author approval) |
| 7 | **DUT-VTUAV** | 500 seqs, 1.7M frames | RGB+Thermal UAV | Google Drive (rclone — see §12) |
| 8 | **BIRDSAI** | 48 TIR sequences | Aerial wildlife thermal | LILA (`wget`) |
| 9 | **HIT-UAV** | 2,898 IR images | High-altitude IR detection | Kaggle CLI |

Datasets missing their annotation JSON (VT-MOT, MVSS, AntiUAV300, BIRDSAI, HIT-UAV) are automatically excluded at training time and the remaining sampling weights are renormalised.

### Unified annotation format

All datasets are converted to a single JSON structure regardless of their original format (MOT `gt.txt`, YOLO normalised coords, segmentation masks, MP4 video):

```json
{
  "sequence_name": {
    "0": {
      "000001": [x1, y1, x2, y2],
      "000002": [x1, y1, x2, y2],
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

The outer `"0"` key represents the object track ID (always 0 for single-object tracking). Frame keys are zero-padded 6-digit integers. Coordinates are pixel-space `[x1, y1, x2, y2]`.

### Dataset annotation samples

Sample IR frames with ground-truth bounding boxes from each training dataset (4 sequences × 4 frames — full report at [`report/datasets_annotation_check.pdf`](report/datasets_annotation_check.pdf)):

**Anti-UAV 410** — IR UAV targets (tiny, high-altitude)
![Anti-UAV 410](docs/ds_strip_Anti_UAV_410.jpg)

**MSRS** — Paired IR/visible road scenes (vehicles, pedestrians)
![MSRS](docs/ds_strip_MSRS.jpg)

**MassMIND** — Maritime LWIR (vessels)

## 6. Training Details

### System requirements

| Component | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| OS | Ubuntu 20.04+ |
| GPU | CUDA 11.8-compatible (AWS `g4dn` or `p3` recommended) |
| Storage | ≥ 300 GB on data partition (datasets + checkpoints) |

Python packages are installed automatically. Key dependencies: `torch + torchvision` (CUDA 11.8), `opencv-python`, `yacs`, `onnx`, `onnxruntime`, `gdown`, `tensorboard`.

### Run training directly

After the pipeline has set up the environment and data:

```bash
conda activate pysot
python train_siamrpn_aws.py \
    --cfg  pysot/experiments/siamrpn_r50_alldatasets/config.yaml \
    --pretrained pretrained/sot_resnet50.pth
```

### Siamese pair sampling

Each epoch draws **10,000 (template, search) pairs** stochastically:

1. A dataset is chosen according to its `sample_prob` (see table below).
2. A random sequence is drawn from that dataset.
3. A valid frame pair `(t, t + δ)` is sampled — δ ∈ [1, 100] frames.
4. Template (127×127) and search (255×255) crops are extracted with random augmentation.

At batch size 32 this gives **≈ 312 gradient steps per epoch**, independent of total dataset size. This is intentional — it keeps each epoch a fixed, predictable wall-clock duration and lets you control total training cost via epoch count, not dataset size.

#### Dataset sampling probabilities

Probabilities are non-proportional — smaller, task-critical IR-specific datasets are upweighted to ensure the model sees balanced examples across object scales and thermal conditions:

| Dataset | Sequences | Config weight | `sample_prob`* | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| AntiUAV410 | 200 | 3.0 | 0.400 | Primary target — IR drone tracking, highest priority |
| DUT-VTUAV | 225 | 2.5 | 0.333 | Large-scale multi-category UAV, good diversity |
| MSRS | 541 | 1.0 | 0.133 | Paired IR/visible — ground-level object variety |
| MassMIND | 1,801 | 1.0 | 0.133 | Maritime domain — downweighted despite large size |
| VT-MOT | 582 | 2.0 | — | Active if annotation present; IR multi-object diversity |
| MVSS | — | 1.5 | — | Active if annotation present |
| Anti-UAV300 | — | 2.5 | — | Active if annotation present; same domain as AntiUAV410 |
| BIRDSAI | 48 | 1.5 | — | Active if annotation present; aerial wildlife thermal |
| HIT-UAV | 2,898 | 1.0 | — | Active if annotation present; high-altitude detection |

\* `sample_prob` shown for the 4 currently active datasets. Weights renormalise automatically over whatever datasets have annotation files present.

### Hyperparameters

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Epochs | 500 | |
| Batch size | 32 | |
| Data workers | 8 | |
| Base LR | 0.005 | |
| Videos per epoch | 10,000 pairs | Fixed budget |
| Backbone freeze | Epochs 0–10 | Only neck + RPN head trained initially |
| Warmup | 5 epochs | Linear ramp from ~0 → base LR |
| LR schedule | SGDR | Cosine annealing, restarts at epochs 50 / 150 / 350 |
| Plateau rescue | ReduceLROnPlateau | ×0.3 after 15 stagnant epochs, floor 1e-7 |
| Early stopping | Patience 50, Δ = 1e-4 | Relative validation loss |
| Checkpoint frequency | Every 10 epochs | Rolling window of 2 + best model |
| Gradient clip | Norm = 10 | |

### Learning rate schedule

```
Epochs  0 –  5    Linear warm-up → base_lr (0.005)
Epochs  5 – end   SGDR cosine annealing  (T₀=50, T_mult=2)
                    restarts at: 50 → 150 → 350 → ...
Plateau detected  ReduceLROnPlateau  ×0.3, floor 1e-7
```

The backbone freeze for the first 10 epochs follows the same logic as transfer learning in YOLO — let the task-specific head (neck + RPN) adapt to the new domain first, then fine-tune the backbone at a lower effective learning rate via `BACKBONE.LAYERS_LR`.

### Monitor during training

In a separate terminal, the monitor script polls logs every 30 seconds and auto-evaluates every 25 epochs:

```bash
./monitor_training.sh &
```

TensorBoard:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir pysot/logs/all_datasets
```

## 7. Multi-GPU Training (DDP)

### Background: why not DataParallel?

PyTorch offers two multi-GPU APIs:

| | `nn.DataParallel` | `DistributedDataParallel` (DDP) |
|---|---|---|
| Process model | Single process, multiple threads | One process per GPU |
| Data split | Scatter/gather on every forward | Each rank owns its own data copy |
| Gradient sync | Reduce on CPU after backward | NCCL all-reduce during backward |
| Works with dict inputs | **No** — scatter breaks dict forwarding | **Yes** |
| Scales beyond 1 node | No | Yes |
| Overhead | High (GIL contention, scatter) | Low (async all-reduce) |

PySOT's `ModelBuilder.forward()` takes a `dict` of tensors (`template`, `search`, `label_cls`, ...). DataParallel's internal scatter mechanism cannot shard a dict cleanly across GPUs — it raises errors in PyTorch 2.x. DDP sidesteps this entirely: each GPU runs a fully independent forward pass on its own data slice, then gradients are synchronised via NCCL at the end of backward.

Additionally, PySOT's `resnet_atrous` backbone has dilated convolutions (`dilation=4` in layer 4). When DataParallel broadcasts the weight tensors to replicas, the resulting tensor alignment triggers `CUDA error: misaligned address` inside `conv2d`. DDP never copies weights — each GPU owns its own model replica with properly allocated memory from the start.

---

### How DDP works in 3 steps

```
torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 train_siamrpn_aws.py
         │
         ├── spawns 4 independent OS processes
         │   (rank 0, 1, 2, 3 — one per GPU)

         │   │     → every GPU now has the same         │
         │   │       averaged gradient                  │
         │   └──────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
         │                  │
         │   ┌──────────────▼───────────────────────────┐
         │   │  3. OPTIMIZER STEP                       │
         │   │     All 4 GPUs apply identical updates   │
         │   │     Models stay in sync without          │
         │   │     any weight broadcast                 │
         │   └──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Because the all-reduce **averages** gradients, a DDP run with `batch_size=8` per GPU and 4 GPUs computes the same gradient as a single-GPU run with `batch_size=32` at the same learning rate. You get linear throughput scaling with zero accuracy cost.

---

### The critical ordering rule: `set_device` before `init_process_group`

This is the single most common DDP bug. NCCL creates a CUDA context for inter-GPU communication at `init_process_group` time. If you have not told CUDA which device this process owns yet, all 4 processes create their CUDA context on GPU 0 (the default device), and all training ends up on one card:

```python
# WRONG — all 4 processes end up on GPU 0
def init_distributed():
    dist.init_process_group(backend="nccl")   # ← NCCL binds to default GPU 0
    local_rank = int(os.environ["LOCAL_RANK"])
    torch.cuda.set_device(local_rank)          # ← too late

# CORRECT — each process claims its GPU first
def init_distributed():
    local_rank = int(os.environ["LOCAL_RANK"])
    torch.cuda.set_device(local_rank)          # ← claim GPU before NCCL init
    dist.init_process_group(backend="nccl")   # ← NCCL sees the correct device
```

The symptom of the wrong order: `nvidia-smi` shows GPU 0 at 10–12 GB with 4 processes, and GPUs 1–3 at 3 MB (no training memory).

---

### Effective batch size and learning rate

```
Single GPU    batch_size = 32,   LR = 0.005
              → 1 gradient step on 32 samples

4 GPU DDP     batch_size = 8/GPU × 4 GPUs = 32 effective,   LR = 0.005
              → all-reduce averages 4 × 8-sample gradients
              → mathematically identical gradient step
```

**LR scaling rule:** if you increase effective batch size (e.g., `batch_size=32/GPU` → effective 128), scale LR proportionally: `LR = 0.005 × 4 = 0.020`. The current config uses `batch_size=32` with 4 GPUs (8 effective per GPU), keeping LR at 0.005 for a conservative, stable training run.

---

### How to run

#### Single GPU

```bash
conda activate pysot
python train_siamrpn_aws.py \
    --cfg  pysot/experiments/siamrpn_r50_alldatasets/config.yaml \
    --pretrained pretrained/sot_resnet50.pth
```

#### 4 GPU (DDP via torchrun)

```bash
/data/miniconda3/envs/pysot/bin/torchrun \
    --nproc_per_node=4 \
    train_siamrpn_aws.py \
    --cfg  pysot/experiments/siamrpn_r50_alldatasets/config.yaml \
    --pretrained pretrained/sot_resnet50.pth
```

Use the launcher script (handles log file naming automatically):

```bash
bash start_ddp.sh
```

Or in a persistent tmux session (survives SSH disconnect):

```bash
tmux new-session -d -s training
tmux send-keys -t training 'bash /data/siamrpn_training/start_ddp.sh' Enter
tmux attach -t training        # to watch output
```

#### Resume from a checkpoint (DDP)

```bash
/data/miniconda3/envs/pysot/bin/torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 \
    train_siamrpn_aws.py \
    --cfg  pysot/experiments/siamrpn_r50_alldatasets/config.yaml \
    --pretrained pretrained/sot_resnet50.pth \
    --resume pysot/snapshot/all_datasets/checkpoint_e050.pth
```

---

### Verify all GPUs are being used

Within 30 seconds of launching, all 4 GPUs should show ~2–3 GB memory and high utilisation:

```bash
watch -n 2 nvidia-smi

# Expected output — 4 processes, ~2.6 GB each:
# +----+----------+-------+---+
# |  0 |  2591 MiB| 99 %  |   |
# |  1 |  2591 MiB| 99 %  |   |
# |  2 |  2591 MiB| 97 %  |   |
# |  3 |  2591 MiB| 100 % |   |
# +----+----------+-------+---+

# Per-process breakdown:
nvidia-smi --query-compute-apps=pid,used_memory --format=csv,noheader
# 51418, 2588 MiB   ← rank 0
# 51419, 2588 MiB   ← rank 1
# 51420, 2588 MiB   ← rank 2
# 51421, 2588 MiB   ← rank 3

# If only GPU 0 is used (wrong):
# |  0 |  10661 MiB| 100 % |   ← all 4 processes on GPU 0
# |  1 |      3 MiB|   0 % |
```

If only GPU 0 is used, check that `torch.cuda.set_device(local_rank)` appears **before** `dist.init_process_group(backend="nccl")` in `init_distributed()`.

---

### Gradient-flow / DDP parity test

Before committing to a 500-epoch run, verify gradient flow and DDP correctness by overfitting on 32 real samples. Both single-GPU and DDP should reach loss < 0.5 by epoch 80:

```bash
# Phase 1: single GPU
python overfit_test.py \
    --cfg pysot/experiments/siamrpn_r50_alldatasets/config.yaml \
    --pretrained pretrained/sot_resnet50.pth \
    --samples 32 --epochs 80 --out overfit_1gpu.csv

# Phase 2: 4-GPU DDP
/data/miniconda3/envs/pysot/bin/torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 overfit_test.py \
    --cfg pysot/experiments/siamrpn_r50_alldatasets/config.yaml \
    --pretrained pretrained/sot_resnet50.pth \
    --samples 32 --epochs 80 --out overfit_4gpu.csv

# Compare loss curves
python overfit_test.py --compare overfit_1gpu.csv overfit_4gpu.csv
```

Expected output:

```
  Final (ep 80):  A=0.077  B=0.111  |diff|=0.034
  Both overfit (< 0.50) : YES ✓
  Loss parity (|diff|<0.10): YES ✓

  ✓ DDP and single-GPU converge identically. Gradient flow OK.
```

The DDP run ends slightly higher (0.111 vs 0.077) because with 8 samples per GPU per step, gradients are noisier than a full 32-sample batch. Both clearly overfit, confirming end-to-end gradient flow.

Run the full orchestrated test:

```bash
bash run_overfit.sh
```

---

### What happens to checkpoints and logging with DDP

Only rank 0 (`is_main = True`) writes to disk to avoid 4 processes clobbering the same files:

| Operation | Behaviour |
|-----------|-----------|
| `os.makedirs` | Rank 0 only; other ranks wait at `dist.barrier()` |
| `SummaryWriter` | Rank 0 only; non-main ranks get `tb_writer = None` |
| Checkpoint saves | Rank 0 only |
| Best model saves | Rank 0 only |
| Per-epoch loss logging | Rank 0 logs average of all-reduced loss |
| `logger.info` step logs | All ranks (expected duplicate lines for n GPUs) |


---

## 8. ONNX Export

The model is split into two ONNX files to enable efficient edge deployment — the template is encoded once per target, only the tracker runs every frame.

```bash
python export_onnx.py \
    --cfg  pysot/experiments/siamrpn_r50_alldatasets/config.yaml \
    --ckpt pysot/snapshot/all_datasets/best_model.pth \
    --out  exported/
```

| File | Input shape | Output | When to run |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| `template_encoder.onnx` | `(1, 3, 127, 127)` | `zf_0`, `zf_1`, `zf_2` | Once per target at initialisation |
| `tracker.onnx` | `zf_0/1/2` + `(1, 3, 255, 255)` | `cls (1,10,25,25)`, `loc (1,20,25,25)` | Every frame |

Exported at **opset 11** using the TorchScript-based exporter (`dynamo=False`) to correctly handle the depth-wise cross-correlation's dynamic group convolution. The script automatically runs the ONNX checker and an ONNX Runtime validation pass after export.

---

## 9. Evaluation

```bash
python eval_onnx.py \
    --work_dir /home/ubuntu/siamrpn_training \
    --onnx_dir /home/ubuntu/siamrpn_training/exported \
    --out_json eval_results/epoch_150.json \
    --epoch    150 \
    --max_seqs 20 \
    --max_frames 150
```

Evaluates on 4 test datasets: Anti-UAV410, MSRS, MassMIND, DUT-VTUAV.

**Metrics (per sequence and per dataset):**

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Mean IoU | Average Intersection over Union across frames |
| Success rate | Fraction of frames with IoU ≥ 0.5 |
| AUC | Area under the success curve at IoU thresholds 0.0–1.0 |

Results written to `eval_results/epoch_NNNN.json`.

## 10. Demo Videos

**ONNX tracker demo** — renders GT (green) vs. predicted (yellow dashed) boxes with per-frame IoU overlay:

```bash
python run_onnx_tracker.py \
    --work_dir /home/ubuntu/siamrpn_training \
    --seqs_per_dataset 3 \
    --max_frames_per_seq 200 \
    --fps 15 --width 640 --height 480
```

Output: `demo/onnx_tracker_demo.mp4`

**Ground-truth demo** — useful for inspecting annotation quality before or during training:

```bash
python make_test_demo.py \
    --work_dir /home/ubuntu/siamrpn_training \
    --seqs_per_dataset 4 \
    --max_frames_per_seq 120
```

Output: `demo/test_gt_demo.mp4`

---

## 11. Inference Hyperparameters

These parameters control how the tracker decodes the RPN output at inference time and are not trained — they are post-processing choices tuned on a validation set.

| Parameter | Value | What it does |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `EXEMPLAR_SIZE` | 127 | Template crop size fed to the encoder |
| `SEARCH_SIZE` | 255 | Search region crop size fed to the tracker |
| `OUTPUT_SIZE` | 25 | Spatial grid size of the RPN output (25×25) |
| `STRIDE` | 8 | Backbone output stride — each grid cell = 8 px in the search image |
| `CONTEXT_AMOUNT` | 0.5 | Padding fraction when cropping (half the object's mean dimension added on each side) |
| `ANCHOR_RATIOS` | [0.33, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0] | Aspect ratios — covers tall, square, and wide targets |
| `ANCHOR_SCALES` | [8] | Single scale; multi-scale handled by FPN at the feature level |
| `PENALTY_K` | 0.04 | Penalises large jumps in target size/ratio between frames |
| `WINDOW_INF` | 0.40 | Cosine window weight — suppresses responses far from image centre |
| `LR` | 0.30 | Smooth update rate for bounding box size (prevents jitter) |
| `SCORE_THRESH` | 0.20 | Minimum foreground score to accept a prediction |

**Total anchors per frame:** 25 × 25 × 5 = 3,125. In practice only a handful of anchors near the target will score above `SCORE_THRESH`.

## 13. Operations & Advanced

### Running on a limited root partition

AWS instances often have a small root volume (8–30 GB) that fills up quickly once PyTorch, datasets, and checkpoints accumulate. Use `--install-dir` to redirect everything to a larger data volume:

```bash
./run_aws_training.sh --install-dir=/data
```

This sets automatically:
- Miniconda → `/data/miniconda3`
- Work dir → `/data/siamrpn_training`
- `PIP_CACHE_DIR` → `/data/pip_cache`
- `CONDA_PKGS_DIRS` → `/data/conda_pkgs`
- `TORCH_HOME` → `/data/torch_cache`

### Downloading DUT-VTUAV via rclone

DUT-VTUAV (~200 GB) exceeds gdown's Google Drive quota. Use rclone to download directly to the server at full network speed.

**Step 1 — authenticate on your local machine (has a browser):**

```bash
rclone authorize "drive"
```

Sign in, allow access, then copy the JSON token from the terminal.

**Step 2 — configure rclone on the server:**

```bash
rclone config
# → n (new remote), name: gdrive, storage: drive
# → blank for client_id, client_secret, root_folder_id
# → scope: 1 (full access)
# → n for auto config (headless server)
# → paste the JSON token from Step 1
```

**Step 3 — download train split only:**

```bash
rclone copy \
  --drive-root-folder-id 1GwYNPcrkUM-gVDAObxNqERi_2Db7okjP \
  --include "train_*/**" \
  --progress --transfers 8 \
  gdrive: /data/dut_vtuav_raw/
```

Monitor progress: `watch -n 10 "du -sh /data/dut_vtuav_raw/"`

### DUT-VTUAV annotation notes

DUT-VTUAV is recorded at **10 fps** but annotated at **1 fps**. Annotation line `i` maps to frame `i × 10`. The conversion in `run_aws_training.sh` accounts for this automatically.

| Split | Sequences | Annotated frames |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Train | 225 | 52,640 |
| Test  | 25 | 5,738 |

Sample IR frames across object categories:

| Excavator | Car | Pedestrian |

## 14. Changelog & Development Notes

This section documents every significant change made to the training pipeline, including the reasoning behind each decision. Intended as a reference when resuming work or debugging regressions.

### 2026-04-14 — Multi-GPU Training

#### Problem: DataParallel fails with PySOT

The original script ran on a single GPU despite the instance having 4× Tesla T4 GPUs (64 GB total VRAM available). The first attempt to add `nn.DataParallel` failed in two distinct ways:

**Failure 1 — dict scatter error.**
`ModelBuilder.forward()` expects a single dict argument `{'template': ..., 'search': ..., 'label_cls': ...}`. `DataParallel` scatters inputs positionally across GPUs and cannot shard a dict. PyTorch 2.x raises a `TypeError` at the first forward pass.

**Failure 2 — CUDA misaligned address.**
Even after wrapping the model in a `ModelForwardWrapper` that converts the dict to positional args, a `RuntimeError: CUDA error: misaligned address` appeared inside `resnet_atrous.py`. The root cause: PySOT's dilated ResNet-50 uses `dilation=4` in layer 4. When DataParallel broadcasts weight tensors to GPU replicas, the replica allocations are not aligned to the boundary that the CUDA dilation kernel requires. This is a PyTorch-level issue with how DataParallel copies non-contiguous dilated conv weights — not fixable without patching the CUDA kernel.

#### Intermediate step: gradient accumulation (single GPU)

Before implementing DDP, gradient accumulation was added as a stopgap — it keeps memory per step low by accumulating gradients over `GRAD_ACCUM_STEPS=4` mini-batches before calling `optimizer.step()`. This gives an effective batch of `32 × 4 = 128` on a single GPU without multi-GPU overhead.

Config key added to `pysot/core/config.py` (yacs requires explicit schema declaration):
```python
__C.TRAIN.GRAD_ACCUM_STEPS = 1   # default: no accumulation
```

Gradient accumulation in `run_epoch`:
```python
(loss / accum_steps).backward()   # scale loss so accumulated gradient = mean
if (step + 1) % accum_steps == 0 or (step + 1) == len(loader):
    clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), cfg.TRAIN.GRAD_CLIP)
    optimizer.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
```

#### Final fix: DistributedDataParallel (DDP)

DDP was implemented via `torchrun --nproc_per_node=4`. Each GPU gets its own independent OS process — no scatter, no weight broadcast, no GIL contention. Gradients are synchronised via NCCL all-reduce during backward, which averages gradients across all ranks. The model stays in sync without any explicit parameter copying.

Changes to `train_siamrpn_aws.py`:

| Location | Change |
|----------|--------|
| Imports | Added `torch.distributed as dist`, `DistributedDataParallel as DDP` |
| New function | `init_distributed()` — returns `(rank, local_rank, world_size, is_main)` |
| `main()` | Call `init_distributed()` as the very first thing, before seeding |
| `main()` | `device = torch.device(f"cuda:{local_rank}")` |
| `main()` | `model = DDP(model, device_ids=[local_rank], output_device=local_rank)` |
| `main()` | `raw_model = model.module if isinstance(model, DDP) else model` |
| `main()` | `makedirs`, `SummaryWriter`, checkpoints gated on `is_main` |
| `main()` | `dist.barrier()` after makedirs so rank 0 creates dirs before others proceed |
| `main()` | `total_len = VIDEOS_PER_EPOCH // world_size` per rank |
| `run_epoch()` | `raw_model = model.module if hasattr(model, "module") else model` |
| Bottom | `dist.destroy_process_group()` on exit |

---

#### Bug: all 4 processes on GPU 0

After the initial DDP implementation, `nvidia-smi` showed all training memory on GPU 0:

```
GPU 0: 10661 MiB   ← 4 processes × ~2500 MiB
GPU 1:     3 MiB
GPU 2:     3 MiB
GPU 3:     3 MiB
```

**Root cause:** `dist.init_process_group(backend="nccl")` was called before `torch.cuda.set_device(local_rank)`. NCCL creates a CUDA context for inter-GPU communication at `init_process_group` time. Without an explicit device assignment beforehand, all 4 processes bind their NCCL context to the default device (GPU 0).

**Fix — swap the order in `init_distributed()`:**

```python
# Before (wrong):
dist.init_process_group(backend="nccl")
local_rank = int(os.environ["LOCAL_RANK"])
torch.cuda.set_device(local_rank)   # too late — NCCL already bound to GPU 0

# After (correct):
local_rank = int(os.environ["LOCAL_RANK"])
torch.cuda.set_device(local_rank)   # claim device first
dist.init_process_group(backend="nccl")   # NCCL sees the correct device
```

After the fix, `nvidia-smi` shows all 4 GPUs active:

```
GPU 0: 2591 MiB  99 %
GPU 1: 2591 MiB  99 %
GPU 2: 2591 MiB  97 %
GPU 3: 2591 MiB 100 %
```

---

#### Bug: `AttributeError: 'DistributedDataParallel' object has no attribute 'backbone'`

`run_epoch` had:
```python
raw_model = model   # model is the DDP wrapper — has no .backbone
for m in raw_model.backbone.modules():   # AttributeError
```

Fix:
```python
raw_model = model.module if hasattr(model, "module") else model
```

This pattern needs to appear in every function that accesses the underlying PySOT model attributes directly (`backbone`, `neck`, `rpn_head`).

---

### 2026-04-14 — Dataset Fixes

#### DUT-Anti-UAV removed

The `DUTAntiUAVDataset` class and its config section were removed. The dataset's annotation files were never successfully converted to PySOT format and the code was dead weight. Removing it:
- Cleaned up the dead class from `train_siamrpn_aws.py`
- Removed the `DUTANTIUAV` block from `config.yaml`
- Updated `NAMES` list in config
- Removed the dataset from the README sampling table

The remaining 9 datasets (8 active, 1 conditional) are unaffected.

#### DUT-VTUAV: wrong frame index

**Problem:** DUT-VTUAV is filmed at 10 fps but annotated at 1 fps. The `groundtruth.txt` has one bbox per second. The original converter wrote annotation line `i` as frame key `i`, causing all annotations to map to the first 10% of frames.

**Fix:** Frame key = `i × 10`. Line 0 → frame 0, line 1 → frame 10, line 2 → frame 20, etc.

```python
# Before:
frame_key = f"{i:06d}"

# After:
frame_key = f"{i * 10:06d}"
```

This moves all annotation keys to the correct positions in the video.

#### MSRS: placeholder bounding boxes

**Problem:** MSRS is a semantic segmentation dataset. The original annotation converter assigned placeholder bboxes `[0, 0, 640, 480]` (the full image) to every frame because it didn't extract actual object positions from the segmentation masks.

**Fix:** Extract the bounding box of the largest connected component from the segmentation label image:

```python
# Load binary segmentation mask, find contours, take largest
contours, _ = cv2.findContours(mask, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
largest = max(contours, key=cv2.contourArea)
x, y, w, h = cv2.boundingRect(largest)
bbox = [x, y, x + w, y + h]
```

Sequences where no contour is found (fully background frames) are skipped.

#### MSRS: frame finder returning wrong images

**Problem:** The `_find_image` method in `MSRSDataset` always returned `files[0]` for `frame_id=1` and `files[1]` for `frame_id=2`, regardless of which pseudo-sequence (`seq`) was being loaded. All training pairs were drawn from the first two images in the IR directory.

**Root cause:** The sequence key encodes the starting image index (`msrs_train_NNNNN`), but the frame finder was not using it.

**Fix:** Parse the sequence index from the key and offset by `frame_id - 1`:

```python
seq_idx = int(seq.rsplit("_", 1)[-1])   # extract N from msrs_train_N
idx = seq_idx + (frame_id - 1)          # frame 1 → files[N], frame 2 → files[N+1]
return os.path.join(self.ir_dir, sorted_imgs[idx])
```

---

### 2026-04-14 — New Scripts

#### `overfit_test.py`

A gradient-flow and DDP correctness verification script. Pre-loads `N` real sample pairs (default 32) from Anti-UAV410 into memory — no runtime randomness, same data every run. Trains for E epochs with Adam, logs loss to CSV.

Run in both single-GPU and DDP mode, then compare with `--compare`:

```bash
python overfit_test.py --out overfit_1gpu.csv
torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 overfit_test.py --out overfit_4gpu.csv
python overfit_test.py --compare overfit_1gpu.csv overfit_4gpu.csv
```

Verified result (2026-04-14):
- Single GPU final loss: **0.077** ✓
- 4-GPU DDP final loss: **0.111** ✓
- Both below threshold 0.50 — gradients flow correctly end-to-end in both modes

The small gap (0.077 vs 0.111) is expected: DDP uses `batch_size=8/GPU` (noisier gradients) while single-GPU uses `batch_size=32` (lower variance). Both clearly overfit, confirming there are no dead weights or broken loss paths.

#### `start_ddp.sh`

Convenience launcher that calls torchrun with the correct config and auto-names the log file by timestamp:

```bash
bash start_ddp.sh   # writes logs/train_ddp_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log
```

#### `run_overfit.sh`

Orchestrates the full two-phase overfit test (single-GPU → DDP → compare) as a single command:

```bash
bash run_overfit.sh
```

## 15. Training Bug: Dataset Preprocessing Root Cause Analysis

> **Date:** 2026-04-15  
> **Severity:** Critical — the entire training run produced a non-functional model  
> **Status:** Fixed and re-training in progress

---

### Symptom

The tracker trained for 140 epochs with a final training loss of **0.26** — seemingly good convergence. However:

- On `ir_crop.mp4`: tracker drifts to the top-right corner within 15 frames, confidence 0.97–0.99 throughout
- On **Anti-UAV 410 training sequences** (data the model was trained on): **Mean IoU = 0.000** across all tested sequences
- Score heatmap peaks 40–50 px away from actual target with 0.97–0.99 confidence

The model tracked the wrong location on its own training data. This confirmed the model was fundamentally broken, not just under-trained.

---

### Investigation

**Step 1 — Rule out inference bugs.** The init box was verified visually to lie on the target. Rotation (−90° CCW) was confirmed correct by comparing scores: CCW gave 0.661 vs CW 0.547. Preprocessing was confirmed correct (raw 0–255 BGR float32).

**Step 2 — Test on training data.** Running the PyTorch tracker on three Anti-UAV 410 training sequences:

| Sequence | Frames tracked | Mean IoU | Observation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `01_1667_0001-1500` | 50 | 0.003 | Drifts to top-right corner from frame 1 |
| `01_1751_0250-1750` | 50 | 0.009 | Same pattern, high confidence (0.7–0.8) |
| `01_2192_0001-1500` | 50 | 0.000 | Drifts immediately, confidence 0.89–0.97 |

All sequences show the identical drift pattern: **x increases, y decreases every frame** toward the top-right, with high confidence. This is impossible if training worked correctly.

**Step 3 — Trace the dataflow.** Reading `train_siamrpn_aws.py` alongside PySOT's `augmentation.py` revealed two compounding bugs.

---

### Root Cause: Two Bugs in the Preprocessing Pipeline

PySOT's `Augmentation` class was designed for one specific input format: **pre-cropped square patches with the target at the image centre**. The custom dataset classes passed **full rectangular video frames** instead. This violated the core assumption of the entire pipeline.

#### Bug 1 — `Augmentation.__call__` ignores the annotation position

`pysot/pysot/datasets/augmentation.py`, line 119:

```python
def __call__(self, image, bbox, size, gray=False):
    shape = image.shape
    crop_bbox = center2corner(Center(shape[0]//2, shape[1]//2, size-1, size-1))
    #                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^
    #                                 H//2 used as X   W//2 used as Y  ← SWAPPED for non-square
    image, bbox = self._shift_scale_aug(image, bbox, crop_bbox, size)
```

The crop is always centred at `(shape[0]//2, shape[1]//2)` — which swaps height and width for non-square images, AND ignores the annotation position entirely. For a 640×512 frame:

| What it should be | What it was |
|---|---|
| Crop centred on annotation at e.g. (320, 264) | Crop centred at (256, 320) — off-centre AND swapped |
| 127×127 region around the drone | 126×126 region from the wrong part of the image |

For a 640×512 image with `size=127`, the augmented crop covers only **20% of image width** and **25% of image height**. If the drone is not in that central strip, the template/search patches contain **only background**.

#### Bug 2 — `_get_bbox` also uses image centre, not annotation centre

`train_siamrpn_aws.py`, both `AntiUAV410Dataset._get_bbox` and `IRTrackingDatasetBase._get_bbox`:

```python
def _get_bbox(self, image, anno):
    if len(anno) == 4:
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = anno
        w, h = x2 - x1, y2 - y1
    # BUG: annotation centre is completely ignored for position
    cx, cy = image.shape[1]//2, image.shape[0]//2   # ← always image centre
    return center2corner(Center(cx, cy, w*sc, h*sc))
```

The annotation's `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` is used only to compute box **dimensions** — the centre `(cx, cy)` is hardcoded to the image centre. So the bounding box fed to `AnchorTarget` is always centred at `(W//2, H//2)` regardless of where the annotation actually is.

#### Combined effect

Training pairs were constructed as follows:

1. Full frame loaded (e.g. 640×512 with drone at annotation position)
2. Augmentation crops **126×126 pixels from the wrong location** in the frame
3. `AnchorTarget` receives a bbox claiming the target is at **image centre** regardless of where the drone is
4. Over 140 epochs the model learns: *"when cross-correlating two random background patches, output a high-confidence response at a consistent offset from centre"*

The low training loss (0.26) reflects the model memorising a spurious statistical pattern in the background, not learning to track targets.

**Why this was hidden:** For sequences where the drone happens to be near the image centre (e.g. Anti-UAV 410 has many centred shots), some training pairs were approximately correct. Loss appeared to decrease, giving a false signal of progress.

---

### The Fix: `_get_center_crop()`

Added a standalone helper `_get_center_crop()` in `train_siamrpn_aws.py` before the dataset classes:

```python
def _get_center_crop(image, anno, output_size, exemplar_size):
    """
    Extract a square crop of `output_size` pixels centred on `anno`,
    then resize to output_size × output_size.
    
    This ensures the target annotation is at the IMAGE CENTRE of the
    returned crop — the prerequisite for PySOT's Augmentation pipeline.
    """
    x1, y1, x2, y2 = anno
    w, h = x2-x1, y2-y1
    cx, cy = (x1+x2)/2, (y1+y2)/2              # actual annotation centre
    
    context = 0.5 * (w + h)
    s_z = sqrt((w + context) * (h + context))  # PySOT context window
    
    # Extract s_z × (output_size/exemplar_size) pixels from original image,
    # centred on the annotation, then resize to output_size.
    orig_crop_size = s_z * (output_size / exemplar_size)
    # ... pad and crop centred at (cx, cy) ...
    # Returns: (output_size×output_size image, new_anno at image centre)
```

Both `AntiUAV410Dataset.__getitem__` and `IRTrackingDatasetBase.__getitem__` now call this before passing to `Augmentation`:

```python
# Before (broken):
template, _ = self.template_aug(t_img,   self._get_bbox(t_img,   t_anno), 127)
search,   _ = self.search_aug(  s_img,   self._get_bbox(s_img,   s_anno), 255)

# After (fixed):
t_crop, t_anno_c = _get_center_crop(t_img, t_anno, 254, 127)   # 254 = 2× exemplar
s_crop, s_anno_c = _get_center_crop(s_img, s_anno, 510, 127)   # 510 = 2× search
template, _ = self.template_aug(t_crop, self._get_bbox(t_crop, t_anno_c), 127)
search,   _ = self.search_aug(  s_crop, self._get_bbox(s_crop, s_anno_c), 255)
```

**Why 2× size for Augmentation input:**
- Template: 254×254 input → Augmentation crops 126×126 from centre → ±4px shift stays within bounds  
- Search: 510×510 input → Augmentation crops 254×254 from centre → ±64px shift positions target randomly within 255×255 output

After the fix, `_get_bbox` receives a **square** image so `shape[0]//2 = shape[1]//2` — the swap bug cancels out and the centre is correct.

---

### Validation

**Sanity check:** `_get_center_crop` with Anti-UAV 410 annotation `[298, 247, 342, 281]`:
```
Template crop: (254, 254, 3)   new_anno centre: (127.0, 127.0) ✓
Search   crop: (510, 510, 3)   new_anno centre: (255.0, 255.0) ✓
```

**Gradient flow (10 steps, 8 real samples):**

| Step | Total loss | Cls loss | Loc loss |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2.181 | 1.297 | 0.737 |
| 5 | 1.380 | 0.026 | 1.128 |
| 10 | 1.202 | 0.023 | 0.983 |

Starting loss ~2.18 (realistic for SiamRPN++) vs the broken model's ~0.26. The model is learning.

**Re-training convergence:**

| Epoch | Train loss | Val loss |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1.692 | 1.453 |
| 2 | 1.247 | 1.120 |
| 3 | 1.010 | 0.914 |
| 4 | 0.853 | 0.783 |

Healthy monotonic decrease. Re-training is ongoing.

### Dataflow Debug Visualisation

A comprehensive visualisation script (`debug_dataflow.py`) was written to inspect every step of the preprocessing pipeline for all four active datasets. For each dataset, 3 random training pairs are shown across 5 steps:

| Step | What is shown |
|---|---|
| **Step 0 — Raw input** | Full frame with GT annotation box (green). Coordinates, size, aspect ratio printed. |
| **Step 1 — Center crop** | 254×254 template / 510×510 search after `_get_center_crop`. Orange box = new annotation. White crosshair = image centre (should coincide with annotation centre). |
| **Step 2 — Augmentation** | 127×127 template / 255×255 search after `Augmentation`. Gold box = `_get_bbox` output. Blue box = `aug_bbox` passed to `AnchorTarget`. |
| **Step 3 — Anchor labels** | 25×25 cls map (red=positive, grey=negative, yellow=ignore). Positive anchor centres overlaid on search. Regression delta heatmap. |
| **Step 4 — Model tensors** | Individual B/G channels as heatmaps. Tensor stats: shape, min, max, mean, std. Confirms raw 0–255 float32 (no normalisation). |

### Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify training pairs visually** before running a long training job. A single call to `debug_dataflow.py` would have caught this immediately.
2. **Test on training data first.** If a model cannot track sequences it was trained on, the training pipeline is broken regardless of loss values.
3. **Low training loss does not mean correct training.** The model achieved 0.26 loss by memorising a spurious background correlation pattern. Always sanity-check with IoU on held-out tracking sequences.
4. **PySOT Augmentation assumes pre-cropped inputs.** The `Augmentation` class was designed for square patches with target at centre. Never pass full rectangular frames directly.

### Visual comparison

**Frame 100 — early tracking (both models on-target)**

![Early tracking](docs/comparison_early_tracking_f100.jpg)

**Frame 2500 — mid-video (official leading by a wide margin)**

![Mid video](docs/comparison_mid_video_f2500.jpg)

**Frame 3950 — official model collapses; fine-tuned model still active**

![Official failure](docs/comparison_official_failure_f3950.jpg)

**Frame 4400 — fine-tuned recovers; official still lost**

![Best recovery](docs/comparison_best_recovery_f4400.jpg)

### Interpretation

The official PySOT model was trained on millions of **RGB** frames (VID, YoutubeVOS,
COCO, ImageNetDet) and learned a stable, generalised tracking prior. It outperforms
the fine-tuned model on **4 out of 6 segments** and is **4× more spatially stable**
(2.1 vs 8.7 px/frame median drift) and **2.4× less score-erratic**.

Fine-tuning on IR data improved recovery in the hard late segment (frames 4000+),
where the RGB-trained model completely loses the target. However it degraded
everything else. Likely causes:

1. **Training data is too homogeneous** — single video or similar scenes → model
   memorises scene features rather than generalising to IR appearance.
2. **Insufficient regularisation** — the fine-tuned RPN over-fits the IR domain
   and loses the stable RGB prior without gaining a robust IR one.
3. **Early stopping at epoch 123** was correct by val-loss, but val-loss does not
   measure spatial stability.

**Next steps to beat the official model on all segments:**
- More diverse IR training sequences (multiple scenes, altitudes, weather)
- Data augmentation: random brightness/contrast for thermal, simulated noise
- Lower LR fine-tuning of the full model (backbone + neck + head jointly, LR ≈ 1e-4)
- Evaluate on a held-out IR sequence, not the same video used during training

## 18. Findings from Debug Analysis

### 1 — Diffuse correlation response causes score drops

The CLS heatmap (Pages 3, 4, 5 of debug PDF) shows a **flat, spatially uniform** response when score < 0.4. The model has no confident spatial peak — it cannot distinguish the target from the IR background. This happens when the search patch no longer contains the target's original appearance (drift accumulation, or abrupt target motion pushing it to the edge of the search area).

### 2 — Consistently positive dw/dh drives bbox growth

At **every** debug frame, the dw and dh regression maps are predominantly positive (warm colours). This means the MultiRPN head predicts `exp(dw) > 1.0` almost everywhere in the search image — systematically larger than the anchor size. After the smooth state update (`width = size*(1−lr) + pred_w*lr`), this adds a few pixels to bbox W/H every frame. Over 5966 frames this compounds to the 5.8× area growth observed.

**Root cause hypothesis:** training data objects (Anti-UAV410 drones) are larger relative to the search crop than this ground vehicle target. The RPN biases toward predicting large boxes because that minimised training loss.

### 3 — Search area growth is a positive feedback loop

`s_x ∝ sqrt(w × h)`. As the bbox grows → s_x grows → the search crop covers more of the image → the model sees more background → correlation response degrades → score drops → bbox grows faster (low-penalty large predictions accepted). Pages 2–4 of the debug PDF show `s_x` growing from ~160 at frame 100 to >400 at frame 4000.

### 4 — Neck features degrade at wrong scale

When `s_x` is 3× the correct value the target occupies only ~9% of the search crop instead of the expected ~50%. The neck features (Row 3 of each debug page) show increasingly diffuse, background-dominated activations as `s_x` grows. The correlation with the (unchanged) template becomes meaningless.

### 5 — Template is stale after long drift

The template is frozen at frame 0. IR targets change appearance over a 4-minute sequence (altitude, aspect angle, thermal emission). By frame 3000+ the template appearance no longer matches the current target. Dynamic template update would recover this.

---

## 19. Recommendations

### Immediate fixes (no retraining required)

#### R1 — EMA template update with size gate

Update the template features slowly when tracking is confident and bbox hasn't grown too large. Implemented in `run_video_inference_updated.py`.

```python
UPDATE_THRESH  = 0.75   # score gate
MAX_SIZE_RATIO = 1.5    # don't update if bbox > 1.5× initial
EMA_ALPHA      = 0.015  # blend rate (very slow)
FROZEN_S_Z     = s_z_at_init  # always crop at init scale, never inflated scale

size_ratio = max(self.size[0]/init_w, self.size[1]/init_h)
if score[best_idx] > UPDATE_THRESH and size_ratio < MAX_SIZE_RATIO:
    new_z = get_subwindow(img, center, EXEMPLAR_SIZE, FROZEN_S_Z, avg)
    new_zf = model.neck(model.backbone(new_z))
    model.zf = [(1-EMA_ALPHA)*o + EMA_ALPHA*n for o, n in zip(model.zf, new_zf)]
```

**Critical:** use the frozen initial `s_z` (not the current inflated one) so the crop scale stays consistent with the template.

#### R2 — Hard clamp on search area growth

Cap `s_x` to `max_s_x_factor × s_z_init` to break the feedback loop:

```python
MAX_SX_FACTOR = 2.5
s_x = min(s_x, MAX_SX_FACTOR * s_z_init)
```

#### R3 — Increase scale penalty

Raise `PENALTY_K` from 0.05 to 0.15–0.20 in `config.yaml`. This more aggressively penalises RPN candidates that are very different in size from the current state, reducing the rate of bbox growth per frame.

#### R4 — Score-gated bbox size update

Only accept bbox size changes when score is high:

```python
SIZE_UPDATE_THRESH = 0.55
if score[best_idx] >= SIZE_UPDATE_THRESH:
    width  = size[0] * (1 - lr) + pred_w * lr
    height = size[1] * (1 - lr) + pred_h * lr
else:
    width, height = size[0], size[1]  # freeze size, only move centre
```

### Training improvements (require retraining)

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Model biased toward large bbox predictions | Add bbox area regularisation loss; balance training data by target/search area ratio |
| Template gets stale | Add online fine-tuning samples to training (UpdateNet approach) |
| Single-video IR data | Add more diverse IR sequences at different altitudes, speeds, backgrounds |
| RGB-domain bias | Ensure all training data is thermal-only (Anti-UAV410 is mixed IR quality) |
| Early stopping at epoch 123 | Train with spatial stability metric (not just cls+loc loss) as early-stop criterion |

### Architecture improvements

| Improvement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Dual template** | Keep `zf_init` (frozen) + `zf_dynamic` (EMA updated). Run RPN head on both, merge scores with `w=0.6/0.4`. Prevents complete drift even if dynamic template degrades. |
| **Template gallery** | Ring buffer of 5 high-confidence templates; each frame select the one giving highest score on current search. Handles appearance variation without drift risk. |
| **Search scale adaptation** | Predict the likely new scale from `loc` output before expanding `s_x`; constrain `s_x` to be consistent with the predicted `dw/dh`. |
